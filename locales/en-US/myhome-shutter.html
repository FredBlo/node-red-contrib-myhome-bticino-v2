<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="myhome-shutter">
<p>Adds a MyHome Shutter Node to your flow.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> (mandatory) is the name of the node</li>
    <li><strong>Topic</strong> is used on received payload to trigger the action on the node (see info in inputs definition)</li>
    <li><strong>Gateway</strong> is the gateway to be configured in order to connect to MyHome system</li>
    <li><strong>Shutter</strong> is the address of the shutter in MyHome system ('A=1 PL=5' becomes '15', also be aware the format is 4 digits when A>9 or PL>9, e.g. 'A=11 PL=5' becomes `1105`, 'A=1 PL=15' becomes '0115')</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>This is a group reference</strong> is to be checked when the shutter address defined has to be used as a group-call address instead of a single shutter (point-to-point call)</li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Enable 'Smart filtering' of gateway events</strong> : when enabled, the node only triggers a new flow (aka output) when a state CHANGED after a MyHome BUS message was received. This is made to avoid multiple flows starting for the same info/command, because MyHome sends the same message multiple times (for status request, response,...)
      <br>Note: SmartFilter is only applied for events received from the BUS (not the node-RED flows)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Skip incoming events from gateway</strong> : when enabled, all MyHome status updates received from the gateway about this node will be ignored, which means only Node-RED received payloads will be processed.</li>
    <li><strong>Read-only</strong> : when enabled, the received payload (being 'OPEN', 'CLOSE', or whatever) is ignored and a status request is sent to gather current shutter state without applying any change.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
  <p><code>msg.payload</code> can be of 2 types</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A simple value
        <ul>
          <li>a simple <em>string</em> being either 'OPEN', 'CLOSE' or 'STOP'</li>
          <li>a simple <em>boolean</em> being either 'true' (for open) or 'false' (for close)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>An Object
        <ul>
          <li> <code>payload.state</code> <em>[string]</em> value must be 'OPEN', 'CLOSE' or 'STOP'</li>
          <li> <code>payload.On</code> <em>[boolean]</em> value must be 'true' (for open) or 'false' (for close)<br>
            (is a fallback when .state is undefined)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p><code>msg.topic</code> is required to trigger the node action: received <code>msg.topic</code> must be set to <code>cmd/xxxx</code> where xxxx is the value defined as Topic in node configuration.</p>

<h3>Outputs</h3>
  <p>The <strong>primary output</strong> is a JSON object <code>msg.payload</code> with</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <code>payload.state</code> <em>[string]</em> value is 'OPEN', 'CLOSE' or 'STOP'</li>
      <li> <code>payload.command_sent</code> <em>[array of string]</em> when the node was triggered from Node-RED (i.e. commands were sent to the MyHome gateway), contains the commands which were sent in OpenWebNet protocol (e.g. <em>'*2*1*15##'</em> to open shutter 1.5)</li>
      <li> <code>payload.command_received</code> <em>[string]</em> when the node was triggered from the gateway (i.e. a command was detected on the MyHome BUS for the configured shutter), contains the command which was read in OpenWebNet protocol (ex: <em>'*2*2*25##'</em> means shutter 2.5 'close' action was started)</li>
      <li> <code>payload.command_responses</code> <em>[array of strings]</em> when the node was triggered from Node-RED in read-only mode, will contain the returned response(s) from the MyHome BUS in OpenWebNet protocol</li>
      <li> <code>payload.command_failed</code> <em>[array of strings]</em> will contain the commands which were refused by the MyHome gateway, in OpenWebNet protocol</li>
    </ul>

  <p>The <strong>secondary output</strong> can be configured to better suits the needs of other node types you use without having to use an extra function/switch node for each connector
    <br>
